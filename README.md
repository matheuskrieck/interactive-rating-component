## The challenge

This is a nice, small project to practice handling user interactions and updating the DOM. Perfect for anyone who has learned the basics of JavaScript!
Your users should be able to:
   - Select and submit a number rating;
   - See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating;
   - See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.


## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Web Design
