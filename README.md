## The challenge

This is a nice, small project to practice handling user interactions and updating the DOM. Perfect for anyone who has learned the basics of JavaScript!
Your users should be able to:
   - Select and submit a number rating;
   - See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating;
   - See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.


## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Web Design
- Vanilla JavaScript

## What I learned

First ever project manipulating the DOM, learned a lot with this one, how to select the elements I needed to change, some new JavaScript events, how to switch the content of the page by hiding entire section of HTML, it was a very fun project.

## Useful resources

1. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
2. [HTML & CSS Cheatsheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/) - Awesome website to remember some CSS selectors and other cool features!
3. [JavaScript Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Very useful documentation, to search about events, and selectors.
